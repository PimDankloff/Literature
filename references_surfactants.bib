	abstract = {Free surface synthetic schlieren (FS-SS) is a liquid surface topography visualization technique relying on apparent dot pattern displacement due to liquid surface deformation. It has gained attention in the fluid visualization field due to its relatively simple and inexpensive setup. One of the most powerful features of the FS-SS technique is the 3D topography of deformed liquid surface, in which submillimeter scale changes can be readily observed in great detail. The visualization of liquid meniscus at the solid interface is proposed in this study to calculate surface tension by equating the surface tension force with weight of light, floating object with circular geometry. It was found that surface tensions of liquids are much greater than anticipated, suggesting that the effect of buoyant force of displaced liquid due to deformed interface cannot be neglected. When the buoyant force is included, the calculated surface tension of liquids are within 10\% of the reference values.},

The measurement of CMC is fundamental in many fields because surfactants are widely used in biology, pharmaceutical chemistry, and materials science. The properties and characteristics of surfactants, including CMC determination are also of major importance in drug delivery. There is no updated review that covers the developed methods to assess the CMC of surfactants. This review aims to survey and discuss various physicochemical and electrochemical approaches for the determination of the CMC. The principle, limitations, and remarks about the difficulties that may arise in the process of CMC determination are also elaborated. Methods that can be used for CMC determination of different types of surfactants (anionic, cationic, non-ionic, and zwitterionic), and methods for low CMC levels are highlighted. The deviations in certain methods from the actual CMC values have also been discussed.},

A key parameter indicating the formation and stability of micelles is the critical micelle concentration (CMC). In this respect, we determined the CMC of common anionic, cationic, and non-ionic surfactants fluorometrically using different fluorescent probes and fluorescence parameters for signal detection and compared the results with conductometric and surface tension measurements. Based upon these results, requirements, advantages, and pitfalls of each method are discussed. Our study underlines the versatility of fluorometric methods that do not impose specific requirements on surfactants and are especially suited for the quantification of very low CMC values. Conductivity and surface tension measurements yield smaller uncertainties particularly for high CMC values, yet are more time- and substance consuming and not suitable for every surfactant.},

	abstract = {Critical micelle concentration (cmc) is a key parameter of generally used surfactants, and many experimental techniques like tensiometry, conductivity, spectrophotometry, fluorometry, etc. for its determination have been reported. However, these contemporary methods for cmc determination are tedious, are time-consuming, are sensitive, and require sophisticated instrumentation. Herein, we demonstrate that the cmc of the surfactants can be estimated via monitoring the variation in the apparent weight of a density bottle floating in a surfactant solution as a function of surfactant concentration. The proposed method requires the use of a simple weighing balance; a cost-affordable instrument always available in scientific laboratories. The proposed method is simple to execute and does not require any complicated data analysis procedures. As an experimental proof attached to the claim, we demonstrate the estimation of the cmcs of all types of surfactants, viz., anionic, cationic, and nonionic, through the formulated method. The results obtained in terms of cmc values of the chosen surfactants closely match those reported through the use of different standardized protocols. The formulated experimental protocol is desirable in terms of the simplicity of the protocol, accuracy, and reproducibility of the results, and cost and accessibility of the required instrument. All these attributes of the presented protocol qualify it as an appropriate substitute to the modern techniques commonly used for the cmc determination.},

	abstract = {It is well-known that surfactant−oil−water (SOW) emulsions undergo substantial changes in drop size (10-fold or more) and stability (up to 4 orders of magnitude) near the phase inversion point. Predicting these changes is important in numerous applications. However, the complex connection between composition, formulation properties, and hydrodynamic conditions limits the ability to predict the outcome of emulsiﬁcation and demulsiﬁcation processes. To address this gap, the hydrophilic−lipophilic deviation (HLD) was used to quantify the proximity to the inversion point, considering the composition of the formulation, temperature, and electrolyte concentration. The net-average-curvature (NAC) equations combined with the HLD predicted the density, interfacial tension, interfacial rigidity, and viscosity for the sodium dihexyl sulfosuccinate (SDHS)− toluene−water system. The predicted properties were incorporated in hydrodynamic models to predict the initial emulsion drop size. The calculated properties and initial drop size were then used in a modiﬁed version of the Davies and Rideal coalescence model that incorporates hole nucleation theory to predict emulsion stability. The predictions were consistent with the changes in emulsion drop size and stability around the phase inversion obtained for the SDHS−toluene−water system, and with stability values reported in the literature for ionic and nonionic SOW systems.},

By fitting pseudo-phase separation models (PSMs) to aqueous solutions of binary surfactant mixtures at selected compositions above the CMC, we avoid the need for expensive simulations of more complex multicomponent mixtures performed as a function of dilution. The approach is demonstrated for sodium laureth sulfate (SLES) surfactants with polydispersity in the ethoxylate spacer. For this system, we find a modest degree of cooperativity in micelle formation, which we attribute to the reduced repulsion between charged headgroups for surfactants with dissimilar ethoxylate spacer lengths. However, this is insufficient to explain the lowered CMC often observed in commercial SLES samples, which we attribute to the presence of small amounts of unsulfated alkyl ethoxylates and/or traces of salt.},

	abstract = {Fluorinated materials play an essential role in modern industry and technology, and their importance is expected to grow even more in the near future. Unfortunately, their practical application often requires dispersion by means of fluorinated surfactants, which raised huge environmental and toxicity concerns due to their long-lasting persistence in the environment and high tendency to accumulate in animals and humans. A greener and more sustainable strategy towards the replacement of synthetic fluorosurfactants is offered by the use of amphiphiles of biological origin. Among them, phospholipids have been the most widely exploited as emulsifiers of fluorous compounds. Some interesting examples were also reported using amphiphilic proteins, in particular fungal hydrophobins, as biosurfactants and coating agents for fluorinated substrates. This perspective offers an overview of the main natural surfactants currently used in fluorine chemistry, focusing in particular on two main application areas: (i) fluorous oil-in-water emulsions and gas microbubbles for biomedical imaging and drug delivery, and (ii) coating and functionalization of solid fluorinated surfaces.},

	abstract = {The selection of appropriate chemicals and the synthetic method plays an important role in oilfield application. The objectives of this study are to describe the various synthetic route for the preparation of fluorinated surfactants and highlight their oilfield applications. Fluorinated surfactants are the type of surfactants where the hydrophobic tail is either partially fluorinated or replaced totally with fluorine molecules. Fluorinated surfactants have distinct properties compared to corresponding hydrocarbon surfactants such as lower surface tension, better efficiency in lowering the interfacial tension, both oleophobic and hydrophobic nature, high thermal stability, and better chemical tolerance. These properties make them a material of choice for several applications which include but are not limited to fire-fighting, household items, foaming, coating, and paints. Despite these attractive properties, environmental concerns associated with fluorinated surfactants is a major hurdle in extending the application of such surfactants. This review discusses the various synthetic routes for the synthesis of different classes of surfactants such as cationic, anionic, non-ionic, and zwitterionic surfactants. The fundamental surface/interface properties of the synthesized surfactants are also highlighted. In addition, the review highlights the application of fluorinated surfactants in the oil \& gas industry.},

The synthesized surfactants including the tertiary amines exhibited desirable properties, including solubility, foamability, and reduction of surface tension. Notably, the anionic surfactants derived from d-GalA demonstrated better solubility and foam performance compared to those derived from l-Ara. In addition, these surfactants exhibited surface tension and critical micelle concentration (CMC) comparable to those of the commercial surfactant sodium lauryl ether sulfate (SLES). Furthermore, the biodegradable surfactant GalA1.8 displayed excellent emulsifying properties and low skin irritation potential.

These anions are combined with the classical 1-alkyl-3-methyl-substituted imidazolium cations ([CnC1Im]+) and a group of oligoether-functionalized imidazolium cations ([(mPEGn)2Im]+) based on methylated polyethylene glycol (mPEGn). In detail, the influences of the length of the alkyl- and the mPEGn-chain, the anion size, and the water content are investigated experimentally. For [CnC1Im]+-based ILs, the surface tension decreases with increasing alkyl chain length in all cases, but the magnitude of this decrease depends on the size of the anion ([NTf2]− {\textless} [PF6]− {\textless} [Br]− ≤ [I]−). Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on [CnC1Im]+-based ILs indicate that these differences are caused by the interplay of charged and uncharged domains, in particular in the different anions, which affects the ability of the alkyl chains of the cation to orient toward the liquid–gas interface. An increase in the mPEGn-chain length of the [(mPEGn)2Im][A] ILs does not significantly influence the surface tension. These changes upon variation of the cation/anion combination do not correlate with the evolution of the HSPs for the two sets of ILs. Finally, our data suggest that significant water contents up to water mole fractions of x(H2O) = 0.25 do not significantly affect the surface tension of the studied binary IL–water mixtures.},

	abstract = {Molecular design is a critical aspect of various scientific and industrial fields, where the properties of molecules hold significant importance. In this study, a 3-fold methodology design is presented that leverages the power of generative artificial intelligence (AI), predictive modeling, and reinforcement learning to create tailored molecules with desired properties. This model synergistically combines deep learning techniques with Self-Referencing Embedded Strings (SELFIES) molecular representation to build a generative model that generates valid molecules and a graphical neural network model that accurately forecasts molecular properties. The Variational Autoencoder (VAE) coupled with reinforcement learning helps refine molecule generation based on targeted attributes. Data from an experimental study involving surfactants were used to test the framework. A validation of the structural integrity of the molecules generated was conducted, and Tanimoto similarities were used to quantify the similarity and diversity between the original and generated molecular structures. Also, saliency maps for the generated surfactants were produced to identify the features explaining the property values. Lastly, molecular dynamics simulations were used to validate the stability of the generated molecules. The results showed that the proposed framework can effectively produce valid molecules within the set property threshold value.},

	abstract = {Hypothesis
Predicting the surface tension (SFT)-log(c) profiles of hydrocarbon surfactants in aqueous solution is computationally non-trivial, and empirically challenging due to the diverse and complex architecture and interactions of surfactant molecules. Machine learning (ML), combining a data-based and knowledge-based approach, can provide a powerful means to relate molecular descriptors to SFT profiles.
Experiments
A dataset of SFT for 154 model hydrocarbon surfactants at 20–30 °C is fitted to the Szyszkowski equation to extract three characteristic parameters (Γmax,KL and critical micelle concentration (CMC)) which are correlated to a series of 2D and 3D molecular descriptors. Key (∼10) descriptors were selected by removing co-correlation, and employing a gradient-boosted regressor model to rank feature importance and carry out recursive feature elimination (RFE). The hyperparameters of each target-variable model were fine-tuned using a randomised cross-validated grid search, to improve predictive ability and reduce overfitting.
Findings
The ML models correlate favourably with test experimental data, with R2= 0.69–0.87, and the merits and limitations of the approach are discussed based on ‘unseen’ hydrocarbon surfactants. The incorporation of a knowledge-based framework provides an appropriate smoothing of the experimental data which simplifies the data-driven approach and enhances its generality. Open-source codes and a brief tutorial are provided.},

Apart from electrostatic barriers that lead to strong deviations, other types of barriers are less easy to identify, because smaller deviations from diffusion controlled mechanisms are evidenced. Complete models involving both diffusion and sorption barriers are very complex and involve many adjustable parameters, making the data analysis frequently unreliable. Empirical equations of state are used in most cases, although they are inaccurate, especially close to the cmc. The variation of sorption energies with surface concentration is not accurately described in the models. Finally, convection can mask the effect of sorption energy barriers.

The concentration model provides an objective definition of the critical micelle concentration (cmc) and yields precise and well defined values of derived physical parameters. The use of a general concentration model eliminates subjective graphical procedures, reduces methodological differences, and thus allows one to compare directly the results of different techniques or to perform global fits. The application and validity of the model are demonstrated with electrical conductivity, surface tension, NMR chemical shift, and self-diffusion coefficient data for the surfactants SDS, CTAB, DTAB, and LAS. In all cases, the derived models yield excellent fits of the data. It is also shown that there is no need to assume the existence of different premicellar species in order to explain the chemical shifts and self-diffusion coefficients of SDS as claimed recently by some authors.},

The technique involves the acquisition of a silhouette of an axisymmetric fluid droplet, and iterative fitting of the Young–Laplace equation that balances gravitational deformation of the drop with the restorative interfacial tension. Since the advent of high-quality digital cameras and desktop computers, this process has been automated with high speed and precision. However, despite its beguiling simplicity, there are complications and limitations that accompany pendant drop tensiometry connected with both Bond number (the balance between interfacial tension and gravitational forces) and drop volume. Here, we discuss the process involved with going from a captured experimental image to a fitted interfacial tension value, highlighting pertinent features and limitations along the way. We introduce a new parameter, the Worthington number, Wo, to characterise the measurement precision. A fully functional, open-source acquisition and fitting software is provided to enable the reader to test and develop the technique further.},

There is increasing interest on this topic because of their unique properties such as low toxicity, functionality under extreme conditions, based on renewable substances and biologically degradable nature. The diversity of these molecules supports their potential application in the field of petroleum, medicine, agriculture, food, cosmetics etc. They are also effective in curtailing the green-house effect by reducing the emission of CO2. They can be termed as ‘green’ because of their low toxicity, biodegradability and relative stability under a wide range of physicochemical environments. In spite of possessing diverse structures and better physicochemical properties than chemical surfactants, biosurfactants are not able to compete with their synthetic counterparts because of their high production \& downstream costs. The commercial realization of these eco-friendly biomolecules is restricted by low productivity, expensive downstream processing and lack of appropriate understanding of the bioreactor systems for their production. But we expect that in future better reactor design and product recovery technology would be developed and overproducer microbial strain would be screened. Then production cost would be decreased and yield would be increased i.e. the production would be both ecologically \& economically favored.

They are involved in the stabilization of droplet interfaces, in the biocompatibility of the system and in the process of molecular exchange between droplets. The recent progress in the applications of droplet-based microfluidics has been made possible by the development of new molecules and their characterizations. In this review, the role of the surfactant in droplet-based microfluidics is discussed with an emphasis on the new molecules developed specifically to overcome the limitations of ‘standard’ surfactants. Emulsion properties and interfacial rheology of surfactant-laden layers strongly determine the overall capabilities of the technology. Dynamic properties of droplets, interfaces and emulsions are therefore very important to be characterized, understood and controlled. In this respect, microfluidic systems themselves appear to be very powerful tools for the study of surfactant dynamics at the time- and length-scale relevant to the corresponding microfluidic applications. More generally, microfluidic systems are becoming a new type of experimental platform for the study of the dynamics of interfaces in complex systems.},

	abstract = {The spread of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens typically existing in biofilm formation and the recent COVID-19 pandemic, although unrelated phenomena, have demonstrated the urgent need for methods to combat such increasing threats. New avenues of research for natural molecules with desirable properties to alleviate this situation have, therefore, been expanding. Biosurfactants comprise a group of unique and varied amphiphilic molecules of microbial origin capable of interacting with lipidic membranes/components of microorganisms and altering their physicochemical properties. These features have encouraged closer investigations of these microbial metabolites as new pharmaceutics with potential applications in clinical, hygiene and therapeutic fields. Mounting evidence has indicated that biosurfactants have antimicrobial, antibiofilm, antiviral, immunomodulatory and antiproliferative activities that are exploitable in new anticancer treatments and wound healing applications. Some biosurfactants have already been approved for use in clinical, food and environmental fields, while others are currently under investigation and development as antimicrobials or adjuvants to antibiotics for microbial suppression and biofilm eradication strategies. Moreover, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, biosurfactants are now being explored as an alternative to current products or procedures for effective cleaning and handwash formulations, antiviral plastic and fabric surface coating agents for shields and masks. In addition, biosurfactants have shown promise as drug delivery systems and in the medicinal relief of symptoms associated with SARS-CoV-2 acute respiratory distress syndrome.},

	abstract = {Surfactants are amphipathic substances with lyophobic and lyophilic groups and are critical components in pharmaceutical products. Surfactants have several uses in pharmaceuticals, i) for solubilisation of hydrophobic drugs in aqueous media, ii) as components of emulsions ,iii) surfactant self-assembly vehicles for oral and transdermal drug delivery, iv) as plasticizers in semisolid delivery systems, and v) as agents to improve drug absorption and penetration. Non-ionic surfactants such as ethers of fatty alcohols are most commonly used in pharmaceuticals. Cationic surfactants are capable of exerting antibacterial properties by disrupting bacterial cell membranes. In pharmaceutical processing, phospholipid lecithin, bile salts, certain fatty acids and their derivatives have become indispensable since they afford a uniquely effective and efficient mechanism of drug carriage by solubilising the drugs of fatty origin. The antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral activities make biosurfactants relevant molecules for applications in combating many diseases and as therapeutic agents. Biosurfactants have the potential for use as major immunomodulatory molecules, as anti-adhesive biological coating for biomaterials, in vaccines and gene therapy, and they may be incorporated into probiotic preparations to combat urogenetical tract infections and pulmonary immunotherapy. Gemini surfactants are effective potential transfection agents for non-viral gene therapy. Ionic liquids act as secondary surfactants and the use of surfactant/ionic liquid systems should be explored to build specific properties in the organized medium, and to explore pharmaceutical applications of traditional, biosurfactant and Gemini surfactants.},

	abstract = {Agricultural productivity to meet growing demands of human population is a matter of great concern for all countries. Use of green compounds to achieve the sustainable agriculture is the present necessity. This review highlights the enormous use of harsh surfactants in agricultural soil and agrochemical industries. Biosurfactants which are reported to be produced by bacteria, yeasts, and fungi can serve as green surfactants. Biosurfactants are considered to be less toxic and eco-friendly and thus several types of biosurfactants have the potential to be commercially produced for extensive applications in pharmaceutical, cosmetics, and food industries. The biosurfactants synthesized by environmental isolates also has promising role in the agricultural industry. Many rhizosphere and plant associated microbes produce biosurfactant; these biomolecules play vital role in motility, signaling, and biofilm formation, indicating that biosurfactant governs plant–microbe interaction. In agriculture, biosurfactants can be used for plant pathogen elimination and for increasing the bioavailability of nutrient for beneficial plant associated microbes. Biosurfactants can widely be applied for improving the agricultural soil quality by soil remediation. These biomolecules can replace the harsh surfactant presently being used in million dollar pesticide industries. Thus, exploring biosurfactants from environmental isolates for investigating their potential role in plant growth promotion and other related agricultural applications warrants details research. Conventional methods are followed for screening the microbial population for production of biosurfactant. However, molecular methods are fewer in reaching biosurfactants from diverse microbial population and there is need to explore novel biosurfactant from uncultured microbes in soil biosphere by using advanced methodologies like functional metagenomics.},

	abstract = {The understanding of the formation, structures, and properties of emulsions is essential to the creation and stabilization of structures in food. The increasing use of surfactants, the identification of compounds with low toxicity and good surface activity properties is of great interest. The relevance of the major end points specified in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) guidelines for the hazard assessment of food chemicals is critically analyzed and main parameters are acute toxicity, subacute repeated studies, allergy, reproductive toxicity, long-term studies, and mutagenicity tests. We focus this article on surfactant association structures and food colloids. There is almost infinite number of combinations are organized and arranged in very complex internal microstructures with various types of assemblies such as dispersions, emulsions, foams, gels, etc. Low-mass surfactants are very mobile at the interface and they are particularly efficient reducing the interfacial tension. As a result, they rapidly coat the freshly created oil-water interface during emulsification. In this category, we mainly mentioned monoglycerides, lecithins, glycolipids, fatty alcohols and fatty acids. High-mass surfactants cover protein and polysacharide groups. The protein molecule may interpenetrate in the lipid phase to various degrees. The specific binding is predominantly electrostatic: The headgroups of the surfactants bind to groups of opposite charge on the protein. The saturation binding for anionic surfactants is pH-independent and seems to be controlled by the cooperative hydrophobic interactions. Polysaccharides and smallmolecule surfactants are two of the predominant groups of amphiphilic materials that have been explored for the stabilization of emulsions. One of the most important aspects of polymer-surfactant systems is their ability to control stability and rheology over a wide range of composition. Biocompatible, biodegradable, and/or nontoxic emulsion-based formulations have great potential for applications in the food. The combination of particular characteristics such as emulsifying, anti-adhesive and antimicrobial activities presented by biosurfactants suggests potential application as multipurpose ingredients or additives.},
